# RPG-Game--Inception-
This is code for a personal project I worked in in school on java. 

This program imported hsa.Console which is not a standard Java Library. 

Due to that you will need to use the java IDE "ReadyToProgam" or any "hsa" version of java in order to run this program.

If you copy the HSA package into the class path you can then run the code.
